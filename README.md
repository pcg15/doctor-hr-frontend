### ABOUT
This repo contains a frontend REACT program. The program contains a text field that allows the user to input the email of their patient and press a SEARCH button that makes a GET request to a server to obtain that particular patient's heart rate data stored in a user database. The information that is retrieved from the database is returned to the app by the server and is displayed as a table in the app showing all recorded patient heart rates listed next to their corresponding time stamps.
